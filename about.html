<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    Hey!
<br>
<br>
    My name is Jack Kelly. I'm a creative from Philadelphia, PA<br>
    currently living in Brooklyn, NY.<br>
    <br>
    When I first graduated college in 2021 (where I studied Ceramics!)<br>
    I was in freefall, and wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life.<br>
    I moved to New York took some odd jobs while I figured things out.<br>
    <br>
    I worked in a tile factory; a movie studio; a 3D printing company; and<br>
    now I'm at a company that develops AI for advertising.<br>
    <br>
    It's clear to me now that I love learning new things; and then going on<br>
    to make <strong>brand new things</strong>.
